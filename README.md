## Vision

The main idea behind OctoPatch is an easy to use integration tool for all kind of scenarios where things should synchronize over several devices or applications. OctoPatch should offer here a drawing area where you can place all required applications or connected devices. They will show up as nodes and offer a bunch of connectors - one connector for each property or state. By drawing lines, all that properties can be synchronized. That means any changes on any of the two sides of the wire will trigger a change on the other side.
